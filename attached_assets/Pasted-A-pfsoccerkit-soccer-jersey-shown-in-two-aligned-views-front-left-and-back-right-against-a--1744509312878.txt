🎯 Front Design – Motion Graphic

The front body explodes with a multi-layered motion burst graphic, engineered to create a sense of controlled chaos and speed.
	•	A diagonal vector blast erupts from the lower left hem, extending upward to the right shoulder in layered angular shards
	•	The core of the burst is pulse red, surrounded by flickering cyan echo lines and jagged glitch-white overlays
	•	Matte silver vapor trails stretch behind the shards, giving a sense of layered depth and motion
	•	A central breathable zone runs down the chest in storm graphite, framed by asymmetrical edges
	•	Sleeves include streaking accents that mirror the core burst, wrapping slightly toward the triceps

⸻

🎯 Back Design – Extended Echo Pattern

The back view mirrors the burst logic in a subtler, more spacious layout, built for number clarity:
	•	A clean graphite field dominates the upper back to host player name and number
	•	The echoed motion pattern emerges from the lower right hem, sweeping up toward the left shoulder blade
	•	Light digital glitches and split-pulse arcs fade upward along the spine
