TASK OBJECTIVE:
Implement a sport-specific dynamic form architecture for the ProJersey AI Kit Designer page. The form allows users to input kit preferences based on the sport selected. Each sport should load a unique set of product types (e.g., jersey-only, jersey + shorts, jacket options) and associated input fields (e.g., collar, sleeves, colors, patterns).

⬇️ USE THE PROVIDED FORM LOGIC (ALREADY LOADED OR AVAILABLE IN /data/Form_Structure_Config.csv):

✅ SUPPORTED SPORTS:
• Soccer
• Basketball
• Rugby
• Cricket
• Esports

✅ PRODUCT TYPE SELECTION LOGIC:
Each sport allows only specific kit combinations:
• Soccer: Jersey | Jersey + Shorts | All training jackets | Tracksuit
• Basketball: Jersey | Jersey + Shorts | All training jackets | Tracksuit
• Rugby: Jersey | Jersey + Shorts | All training jackets | Tracksuit
• Cricket: Jersey | Jersey + Trousers | All training jackets | Tracksuit
• Esports: Jersey | All training jackets | Tracksuit (No shorts or trousers)

✅ FORM INPUT COMPONENTS (shown conditionally based on product type):
• Primary Color [Color Picker]
• Secondary Color [Color Picker]
• Collar Type [Dropdown]
• Sleeve Style [Dropdown]
• Pattern Style [Dropdown]
• Design Notes [Textarea]
• Upload Logo(s) [Optional File Upload]

✅ DESIGN TOKENS (MUST be passed to prompt logic):
Always embed `"pfsportskit"` in the final prompt sent to OpenAI, no matter the sport.

✅ NEXT STEPS:
1. Dynamically render all inputs based on sport → product-type selection (based on CSV config).
2. Connect these inputs to the `generateKitPrompt()` system (already available in the codebase).
3. Ensure default values and disabled options are handled cleanly.
4. Ensure form resets when a new sport is selected.
5. Add a preview of the generated image placeholder after prompt execution.
6. Include hidden field logic for backend tracking: `sport_type`, `product_type_selected`, and `form_payload_hash`.

✅ OPTIONAL UX:
- Show friendly tooltip: “Kit options are based on your sport – only allowed combos are shown”
- If user selects “Away Kit” checkbox, auto-invert primary/secondary colors and flag in payload.

⚙️ FILE LOCATIONS:
• Frontend Form: `client/src/components/design-form.tsx`
• Prompt routing system: `server/openai/generateKitPrompt.ts`
• Form data config: `data/Form_Structure_Config.csv`

⚠️ DO NOT connect this yet to pricing or ordering logic — this prompt only covers UI + prompt input pass-through for AI generation.

Once complete, return a ✅ confirmation and optionally open `design-form.tsx` to show the changes.
