üéØ Goal: Identify why the Stripe Elements component is not rendering, and the checkout flow cannot proceed after design submission.

---

üîç START BY CHECKING FRONTEND (`checkout-page.tsx` and `stripe-payment-form.tsx`):

1. **Inspect `clientSecret` handling:**
   - Confirm if `clientSecret` is being fetched properly from the server.
   - Log the result of `createStripeIntent()` or similar function. If it‚Äôs undefined or null, add a visible error message or toast.
   - If using React state, make sure the `clientSecret` is initialized, set, and passed to `<Elements>`.

2. **Check Stripe `Elements` Mounting:**
   - Ensure the `Elements` wrapper is only rendered when `clientSecret` is truthy.
   - Add fallback UI (e.g., loading spinner or error banner) if Stripe is not mounted.

---

üßæ NEXT, CHECK BACKEND (`server/stripe.ts`, `server/payment.ts`, or `services/stripe-service.ts`):

3. **Review the payment intent or subscription creation logic:**
   - Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` are not placeholders (like `'sk_test_placeholder'` or `'price_test_placeholder'`).
   - Print logs before and after calling Stripe‚Äôs `createPaymentIntent()` or `createSubscription()`.

4. **Return Shape of the Response:**
   - Confirm the backend endpoint is returning:
     ```json
     { clientSecret: "sk_test_..." }
     ```
   - Add status code and error logging for any failures.
   - Handle unexpected errors (e.g., bad price ID, invalid customer ID) and return structured error messages.

---

üì¶ ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Validate `.env` files are loaded correctly ‚Äî check for `process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`
- Confirm that no live key override (`sk_live` check) is silently preventing real keys from being used.
- If needed, create fallback keys inside `dev.config.ts` or similar to prevent build crashes.

---

‚úÖ FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTED:

- Stripe Elements must render correctly in the browser
- `clientSecret` must be present and visible in console log during flow
- Checkout proceeds without freezing
- If something fails, user sees a clear error state or fallback screen

Do NOT modify product logic, form schema, or AI generation. Only inspect and repair the Stripe flow.
