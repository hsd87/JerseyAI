üß† Objective:
Resolve the `[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Failed to fetch` error in the frontend.

üéØ Context:
We're using a React + TypeScript frontend with a shared `queryClient.ts` file that handles fetch requests. The error is triggered when the user configures a product and the app tries to calculate price via `calculatePrice()` or `updatePriceBreakdown()`.

üì∏ Screenshot Reference:
The error occurs at:
`/client/src/lib/queryClient.ts:15` ‚Üí `const res = await fetch(url, { ... })`

Likely involved functions:
- `calculatePrice`
- `updatePriceBreakdown`

‚öôÔ∏è Expected Backend Endpoint:
This fetch is meant to connect to a backend route that calculates dynamic pricing based on form data. It should point to something like `/api/price`.

üì¶ What to Do:

1. **Verify Backend is Running**
   - Check if the backend server (FastAPI / Node / Express) is actively running and accessible on the correct port.
   - Ensure CORS is enabled if needed.

2. **Log Fetch URL and Payload**
   - Add `console.log(url)` and `console.log(data)` before the `fetch()` in `queryClient.ts`.
   - Confirm that the `url` is not `undefined` or empty and is pointing to a real API route.

3. **Check API Route**
   - Open the backend route handler for the dynamic pricing calculation.
   - Make sure it accepts a POST request and handles the incoming payload correctly.
   - Add error logging to the backend if needed.

4. **Update API Base URL**
   - If the API is local, ensure your base URL in `queryClient.ts` is correct:
     - Use `"http://localhost:5000/api"` in development OR
     - Just `"/api"` if using a proxy or monorepo setup.

5. **Handle Missing Headers**
   - If `data` is present, make sure headers are defined:
     ```ts
     headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
     ```
   - Ensure the server expects JSON.

6. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add a `try/catch` block around the fetch and display a user-friendly error if the API fails.

7. **Optional: Disable HMR Overlay**
   - If needed, in `vite.config.js`:
     ```ts
     server: {
       hmr: {
         overlay: false
       }
     }
     ```

‚úÖ Goal: Make sure `calculatePrice()` correctly connects to the backend, receives a valid response, and the UI continues smoothly without crash overlays.

üí° Once fixed, confirm the `Design Summary` and `Price Breakdown` sections reflect accurate pricing and update in real time.
