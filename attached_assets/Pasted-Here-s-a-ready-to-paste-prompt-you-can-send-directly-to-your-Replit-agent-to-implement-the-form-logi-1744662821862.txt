Here‚Äôs a ready-to-paste prompt you can send directly to your Replit agent to implement the form logic, conditional rendering, and pricing integration into the website. It includes:
	1.	Conditional logic per sport
	2.	Product configuration limits
	3.	Training jacket types
	4.	Order detail + matching sets info
	5.	Price table CSV integration

Prompt:

We are now implementing the full product configuration logic into the website. Here‚Äôs what needs to be done:

‚∏ª

üîß 1. Form Logic by Sport & Product Type

Update the input form system with the following conditional logic per sport:

Each user must select a sport first, and based on the selected sport, only the valid base product types should be shown (single-selection logic):

Sport	Available Base Kit Options
Soccer	Jersey, Jersey + Shorts
Basketball	Jersey, Jersey + Shorts
Rugby	Jersey, Jersey + Shorts
Esports	Jersey only
Cricket	Jersey, Jersey + Trousers

‚úÖ All sports also support the following training options as add-ons (can be multi-selected):
	‚Ä¢	Training Jacket (Standard)
	‚Ä¢	Training Jacket Full-Zip
	‚Ä¢	Training Jacket Half-Zip
	‚Ä¢	Training Jacket with Hood
	‚Ä¢	Full Track Suit

‚ùó Ensure the product options are conditionally rendered based on the selected sport. For example, ‚ÄúJersey + Trousers‚Äù is only available in Cricket.

‚∏ª

üì¶ 2. Order Details Section Logic

After the form, add an Order Detail Section with the following components:
	‚Ä¢	Complementary Products Checklist (dynamic, based on what user picked in base set):
	‚Ä¢	Matching Socks
	‚Ä¢	Matching Beanie
	‚Ä¢	Matching Kit Bag or Backpack
	‚Ä¢	Matching Track Suit
	‚Ä¢	All matching items should auto-inherit the color and design scheme from the AI-generated jersey, using inverse or complementary styles.
	‚Ä¢	Add a Tooltip/Info Block that explains:
‚ÄúAway kits will be generated using inverse color schemes of your home kit. For fully different designs, please create and order a separate design. Matching complementary items will follow the same design language and will be shared with you for approval before production.‚Äù

‚∏ª

üí∏ 3. Integrate Pricing Logic from CSV

Please connect the detailed pricing logic using the following provided CSV file:
üìÇ ProJersey_Pricing___Strategy_Table.csv

Use the pricing data to apply:
	‚Ä¢	Per-product base prices
	‚Ä¢	Tiered quantity discounts (e.g., 10+, 20+, 50+)
	‚Ä¢	10% subscription discount
	‚Ä¢	Unified pricing for all users (no separate B2B logic)
	‚Ä¢	Shipping logic:
	‚Ä¢	$30 for orders below $200
	‚Ä¢	$20 for orders between $200‚Äì$500
	‚Ä¢	Free shipping above $500

‚úÖ Also ensure:
	‚Ä¢	Final calculated price is shown dynamically in the UI
	‚Ä¢	Form logic correctly disables or hides irrelevant options
	‚Ä¢	Output pricing + product details are bundled into the PDF order summary

‚∏ª

This implementation will enable a fully dynamic, smart product configurator tailored to each sport while keeping our pricing accurate and flexible.

Once complete, please confirm form rendering works for all sports and pricing calculations align with backend logic.

Let me know if you need the latest CSV again or the latest pricing schema JSON.
