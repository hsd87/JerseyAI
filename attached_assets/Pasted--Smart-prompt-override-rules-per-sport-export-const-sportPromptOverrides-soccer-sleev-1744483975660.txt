Update the OpenAI prompt generation logic to include adaptive garment logic for each sport.

✅ Add this override object to the prompt builder system:

\`\`\`ts
${JSON.stringify(sportPromptOverrides, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

✅ For every kit generation request:
- Check if user has passed sleeve/collar/pattern — use them
- Otherwise fallback to the above defaults based on selected sport

✅ Inject the selected values (sleeve, collar, pattern, structureNote) into the system prompt as context for OpenAI.

✅ Token \"pfsportskit\" must always be present in the first sentence of the prompt.

✅ Smart Structure Enforcement:
- If sport is basketball, auto-enforce sleeveless and remove cuff/hem logic
- If sport is rugby, emphasize reinforced seam structure
- If sport is esports, inject visual neon motifs and stylized mesh trims

Once updated, test with a basketball, rugby, and esports prompt and verify the logic is applied.`;
