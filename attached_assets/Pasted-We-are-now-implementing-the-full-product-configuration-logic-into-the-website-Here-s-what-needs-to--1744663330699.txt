We are now implementing the full product configuration logic into the website. Here's what needs to be done:

üîß 1. Form Logic by Sport & Product Type

Update the input form system with the following conditional logic per sport:

Each user must select a sport first, and based on the selected sport, only the valid base product types should be shown (single-selection logic):

Sport       | Available Base Kit Options
------------|---------------------------------------------
Soccer      | Jersey, Jersey + Shorts
Basketball  | Jersey, Jersey + Shorts
Rugby       | Jersey, Jersey + Shorts
Esports     | Jersey only
Cricket     | Jersey, Jersey + Trousers

‚úÖ All sports also support the following training items (multi-select optional add-ons):

- Training Jacket (Standard)
- Training Jacket Full-Zip
- Training Jacket Half-Zip
- Training Jacket with Hood
- Full Track Suit

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure the product options are conditionally rendered based on the selected sport. For example, "Jersey + Trousers" should only appear for Cricket.

üì¶ 2. Order Details Section Logic

After base product selection, show the ‚ÄúOrder Details‚Äù block with the following:

- Complementary Products (checklist with prices):
    - Matching Socks
    - Matching Beanie
    - Matching Kit Bag or Backpack
    - Matching Track Suit

‚úÖ These items should automatically match the AI design and color scheme of the base kit and follow the same visual theme. 

Add a tooltip/info box that explains:
> ‚ÄúAway kits will be generated using inverse color schemes of your home kit. For fully different designs, please create and order a separate design. Matching items will follow the same theme and will be shown to you before production.‚Äù

üí∏ 3. Integrate Pricing Logic from CSV

Link the pricing system to this provided CSV:
üìÇ ProJersey_Pricing___Strategy_Table.csv

From this file:
- Pull base prices for each product
- Apply tiered quantity discounts (10+, 20+, 50+)
- Apply 10% subscription discount (if user is subscribed)
- Use a single unified pricing model for all users (B2B and D2C)

Shipping Rules:
- $30 for orders below $200
- $20 for orders between $200 and $500
- Free shipping for orders above $500

‚úÖ Show final calculated price dynamically in the UI
‚úÖ Final product breakdown should be included in the downloadable order PDF
‚úÖ Backend logic should match front-end display pricing

Please confirm correct form logic rendering, accurate tier-based pricing calculations, and integration of CSV logic into the frontend and backend pipeline.

Let me know if you need the latest CSV or schema formats.
