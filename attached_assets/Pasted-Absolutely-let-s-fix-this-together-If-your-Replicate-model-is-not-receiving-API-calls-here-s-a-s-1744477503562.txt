Absolutely, letâ€™s fix this together.

If your Replicate model is not receiving API calls, hereâ€™s a structured checklist to debug and resolve it quickly:

â¸»

âœ… Step-by-Step Debug Flow

1. âœ… Confirm the Replicate Endpoint and API Key

Make sure:
	â€¢	Your Replicate model URL is correct. It should look like:

https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions


	â€¢	Youâ€™re using the correct Replicate model version ID (found in your dashboard).
	â€¢	Your Replicate API key is valid and set in the .env file like:

REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_api_key



â¸»

2. âœ… Verify API Call in Backend

Go to the file where your Replicate API is called (e.g., replicate_api.ts, flux_api.py, or server/image-generator.ts) and make sure the headers and body match this structure:

const response = await fetch('https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Token ${process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    version: "your-model-version-id",
    input: {
      prompt: "your prompt here",
      // other params (width, height, etc.)
    }
  })
});



â¸»

3. âœ… Check If the Request Is Being Sent

Add a console.log or logger before the API call to confirm itâ€™s being triggered:

console.log("Sending request to Replicate...");



â¸»

4. âœ… Enable CORS (if frontend is making the call directly)

If the request is made from the frontend (not recommended), ensure your backend is not blocking it due to CORS.

â¸»

5. âœ… View Logs on Replicate

Go to https://replicate.com â†’ Your model â†’ API â†’ View if any request is received or failed.

â¸»

6. âœ… Test Manually

You can test your model via cURL or Postman:

curl https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "version": "your-model-version-id",
    "input": {
      "prompt": "a sleek football jersey"
    }
  }'

If this works, but the app doesnâ€™t â€” itâ€™s a problem with your code integration.

ðŸš¨ If Still Not Working

Tell me:
	â€¢	What error message are you getting (if any)?
	â€¢	Is it a timeout, 403, 400, or something else?
	â€¢	Can you share the code block that sends the API request?

Once you paste that, Iâ€™ll rewrite or fix it for you right away.
