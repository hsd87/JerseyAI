ProJersey Landing Page Wireframe & Customer Journey Strategy

ProJersey is an AI-powered platform for designing and fulfilling custom sports jerseys. The landing page needs to engage individual athletes/fans (D2C) as well as teams and B2B buyers, all within a single, modular page that can grow into a full site later. Below is a detailed wireframe layout, an explanation of each section’s role, distinct customer journey flows for each audience, responsive design considerations, and best practices drawn from top D2C/B2B landing pages.

Suggested Landing Page Wireframe Layout

The landing page is organized into clear content sections, each serving a specific purpose in guiding visitors from awareness to conversion. Sections define the page’s story flow – starting with a strong introduction and followed by key benefits, social proof, and calls to action ￼. The modular design means each section can later expand into its own page if needed, but on the one-pager they appear in this conversion-optimized order:
	1.	Hero Section (Attention) – First-screen impact with value proposition and CTA. This top section grabs attention immediately ￼. It features:
	•	Headline & Subheadline: A bold statement highlighting ProJersey’s unique value (e.g. “Design Pro-Quality Team Jerseys in Seconds with AI”). The copy should stress the benefit to the user (easy, fast, high-quality) ￼. A concise sub-text can add a supporting point (e.g. “No design skills needed – our AI Designer does the work for you”).
	•	Hero Visual: An engaging image or illustration showcasing the platform – for example, a mockup of the jersey design interface on a screen, or an athlete holding a customized jersey. A striking hero image draws the eye and reinforces the message ￼. (On desktop this could be beside the text; on mobile it might be above or below the text in a centered layout.)
	•	Primary Call-to-Action: A prominent button labeled “Start Designing Now” (or similar action-oriented text) invites the visitor to begin immediately. The hero should have one obvious next step ￼. (Optionally, a secondary CTA like “Request Bulk Quote” could be included for B2B, but kept visually subtle to maintain one primary focus).
UI Guidance: Keep this section clean and uncluttered. Navigation, if any, should be minimal (perhaps just a logo and a “Login” or small menu) so as not to distract from the core message ￼. The hero text must be legible against the background (use high contrast). Include a sticky header or down-arrow hint to encourage scrolling if content is below the fold. According to best practices, a strong hero with bold headline, eye-catching image, and clear CTA sets the conversion path ￼ ￼.
	2.	AI Designer Demo (Interest) – Showcase the AI customization tool in action. Immediately after the intro, present a section highlighting how easy and innovative the jersey design process is with ProJersey. This builds visitor interest by demonstrating the core product:
	•	Section Title: “Meet the AI Jersey Designer” (or similar) to introduce the feature.
	•	Description: A brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of how the AI works for the user’s benefit. For example: “Simply tell our AI your team name and colors, and it will generate dozens of custom jersey designs for you. Pick your favorite and tweak it – no design skills needed!” This copy should be engaging and focus on benefits (speed, ease, creativity) rather than technical details.
	•	Visual/Interactive Preview: Show an embedded video clip or an animation of the design interface generating a jersey design. If possible, an interactive element (like a simplified version of the designer or a rotating 3D jersey preview) can invite engagement. The imagery should communicate “high-tech + sports” – for instance, an interface panel alongside a resulting jersey image. (Ensure visuals remain fast-loading and don’t overwhelm; a static image with a play button for a video modal could work as well.)
	•	Micro-CTA: If the section is long, include a button like “Try It Now” that scrolls or jumps the user to the actual design studio. However, this may simply reinforce the main CTA.
UI Guidance: Use a two-column layout on desktop (text on one side, demo on the other) for a balanced look; on mobile, stack the image/video above the text for easy scrolling. Keep this section’s background neutral so the interface screenshots (often busy with colors) stand out. The goal is to immediately validate the value proposition by showing the product’s magic in action – turning curiosity into interest. Following the hero with a key feature demo aligns with effective landing page storytelling, where an intro is typically followed by a highlight of important features or benefits ￼.
	3.	Product Configuration & Features (Desire) – Explain how customization and ordering works, highlighting ease and benefits. This section addresses any questions about “What can I actually do on this platform?” and builds desire by showcasing capabilities and advantages:
	•	How-It-Works Steps: Break down the simple process in 3 or 4 steps with short headings/icons for each. For example: 1) Choose Your Gear – Pick a sport and jersey style from our catalog, 2) AI Generates Designs – Get instant designs to choose from, 3) Customize Details – Add names, numbers, logos easily, 4) Order & Fulfillment – We produce and ship to your door. Each step can have a small icon or image (like a jersey icon, an AI icon/robot, a personalization icon (pencil/edit), and a delivery truck icon). This gives a quick visual summary of the user journey on the platform.
	•	Feature Bullet Points: Below or alongside the steps, list key features/benefits that set ProJersey apart. For D2C individuals: “No Minimum Order – order 1 or 100”, “Professional Quality Fabric & Printing”, “Ships in 7 days”, etc. For teams: “Easy roster upload for player names & sizes”, “Team discounts applied in cart”. For all audiences: “100% Satisfaction Guarantee” or “Free design revisions”, etc. These points should be concise (a phrase each) and could be shown as checkmarks or short bullets in a grid. Emphasize what solves common pain points: e.g., AI assistance (no designer needed), Fast turnaround, Quality assurance, Bulk pricing available.
	•	Comparison Highlight (optional): If space permits, a small comparison call-out can reinforce ProJersey’s advantages. For example, a mini table or infographic: ProJersey vs. Traditional Printing – comparing Design time (minutes with AI vs. days going back-and-forth with a designer), Order size (no min vs. large minimums), Turnaround (1 week vs. 3-4 weeks) etc. This directly addresses competitor alternatives and convinces visitors of unique value ￼.
	•	Embedded Visuals: Use photos of customized jerseys or screenshots of the configurator interface to make it real. For instance, show a partial UI where a user is selecting colors or adding a name on a jersey preview. Another image might show a group of different jersey designs (to illustrate variety), or a stack of packaged jerseys (to imply fulfillment). These visuals support the text by demonstrating outcomes (cool jersey designs, team set ready to go, etc.).
	•	CTA Placement: After explaining the features, include another “Design Your Jersey Now” button. By now, a motivated visitor should be itching to start – having a mid-page CTA captures those who don’t need further convincing. (Multiple CTAs on a long page help nudge users toward conversion as they scroll ￼, while keeping the goal consistent.)
UI Guidance: Structure this section for clarity and scan-ability. Consider using tabs or accordion for features if the list is long (on mobile especially) to avoid a wall of text. Icons and short headings are helpful for quick reading. Maintain visual harmony: use the same style for all step illustrations or icons. This section likely has a light background to differentiate from other sections. Ensuring the content is broken into cards or columns will prevent it from feeling text-heavy – important since too much dense text can hurt engagement on a landing page ￼. The aim here is to educate and excite the visitor by showing that everything they need (and might worry about) is covered.
	4.	Solutions for Teams & B2B (Segment-Specific) – Address the specific needs of coaches, clubs, and bulk buyers. This module speaks directly to those larger customers and assures them ProJersey can handle their requirements. By isolating this content, we keep the main messaging broad while still providing targeted info for those who need it:
	•	Sub-section: Teams & Organizations: Headline example: “Built for Teams of All Sizes”. Brief copy: “Coaches and team managers love ProJersey – coordinate your entire team’s kit in one go.” List features such as Bulk edit player names/numbers (with an interface that lets you input a roster – e.g., upload a spreadsheet or enter names manually), Multiple sizes in one order (youth and adult sizes together), Team Order Discounts (automatically applied for, say, 10+ jerseys), and Reorder Anytime (save designs for future seasons). Emphasize how this saves time and ensures consistency (no mismatched uniforms).
	•	Sub-section: B2B & Resellers: Headline example: “Partner with ProJersey – For Brands, Resellers & Events”. Copy could be: “Need 50+ jerseys or want to resell custom kits? We’ve got you covered with scalable fulfillment.” Highlight points like Wholesale Pricing (tiered discounts for large volumes), White-Label Options (if applicable – e.g., ship with your branding or integrate via API), Dedicated Account Manager for large clients, and On-time Global Fulfillment (important for event organizers or companies that need reliable delivery). If ProJersey offers it, mention support for custom store pages for partners or any special B2B portal.
	•	Visuals: This section could use a two-column layout or even a subtle background change to set it apart. Perhaps use imagery like a team photo (players wearing identical jerseys designed on the platform) for the team part, and a stack of boxes or a store shelf with jerseys for the B2B part. Alternatively, use icons (e.g., a group icon for teams, a building icon for business).
	•	CTA: Provide a clear path for these users: e.g., “Team Order: Start Designing for Your Team” and a “Contact Sales” or “Get Bulk Quote” button for B2B. The B2B CTA might lead to a short form or prompt an email inquiry instead of the standard design flow. Make sure these CTAs are distinct but still aligned in style with the primary one.
UI Guidance: Clearly label these sub-sections so the intended audiences spot them easily (e.g., use icons or headings like “For Teams” and “For Businesses”). On desktop, you might present them side-by-side in two columns; on mobile, stack with the team info first followed by B2B. Keep the copy concise – many details (like exact pricing tiers) can be provided after contact or on a dedicated page later. The goal is to assure these users that “Yes, this platform is also for you” and prompt them to take the next step (design or contact). This not only helps conversion but also signals to all visitors that ProJersey is robust enough to handle both individual and large-scale needs, adding credibility.
	5.	Testimonials & Social Proof (Trust) – Build trust with real-world success stories. By this point, a visitor knows what ProJersey offers; hearing from happy customers can push them from consideration to decision. This section showcases a few testimonials, reviews, or logos that validate the product:
	•	Testimonials: Ideally include 2 or 3 short testimonials that represent different segments:
	•	Individual: e.g., “As a solo athlete, I designed my own jersey for fun – it turned out amazing! The AI gave me ideas I’d never think of.” – Jamal R., Weekend Basketball Player.
	•	Team: e.g., “Our club got 25 jerseys designed and delivered in under two weeks. The team was thrilled with the quality and our coach loved how easy the roster tool was!” – Sarah K., Soccer Coach.
	•	B2B: e.g., “We expanded our sports shop’s offerings by partnering with ProJersey. The custom jersey line is now one of our best-sellers, and fulfillment is seamless.” – Mark D., Retail Buyer.
Each testimonial should have the person’s name, their role or affiliation, and maybe a small image (their photo or their team’s logo, brand logo, etc.) if available. This adds authenticity. Keep each quote to 1-2 sentences for readability.
	•	Ratings/Reviews: If the service has an aggregate rating or has been reviewed on platforms, display a star rating graphic (e.g., ★★★★☆ 4.8/5 average from 500+ customers). Social proof stats like “5000+ jerseys created” or “Used by 100+ teams” can also appear here as bold text.
	•	Client Logos: Another form of social proof: a row of logos (in grayscale) of notable clients or partners (e.g., a well-known local club, a small league, or a retailer that uses ProJersey). Only include these if you have permission; otherwise, stick to testimonials.
	•	Media Mentions (optional): If ProJersey has been featured in press or blogs (“As seen on…”), a small line with those logos could appear for additional trust. This is more common on D2C pages as brag points.
UI Guidance: Use a slider/carousel or card layout if more than one testimonial is present, especially on mobile (so users can swipe through feedback). Highlight at least one quote in larger text as a centerpiece. It’s crucial this section feels genuine – use real language, not marketing speak. Visually, this section often has a subtle background (like a light gray or a soft color) to differentiate it from other content sections. According to conversion research, nearly 89% of consumers read reviews before buying ￼, and B2B clients similarly look for proof of results ￼. Thus, incorporating testimonials here is a best practice to reduce purchase anxiety and lend credibility to the platform.
	6.	Final Call-to-Action (Action) – Closing pitch and repeat CTA to convert. The last full section of the page should reconsolidate the value proposition and provide one more prominent opportunity to act. Not everyone clicks the top hero CTA, so we reinforce it here after they’ve scrolled:
	•	Summary Statement: A short, punchy line that encapsulates the offer and encourages action. For example: “Ready to create your custom jersey? Get started with our AI designer now.” This serves as a final nudge, appealing to the excitement built up by the above content. Keep it very brief and action-oriented.
	•	CTA Button: The main button, again “Start Designing Your Jersey” (or whatever primary wording was used). This should be visually large and possibly animated (a gentle attention pulse or arrow) to draw the eye. On clicking, it takes the user into the sign-up or design process immediately.
	•	Secondary info: Beneath the button, you might include supporting reassurance points or a footer-like summary: for example, “Free shipping on orders over $50 – 100% satisfaction guarantee – Secure Checkout” as small print icons. These reinforce trust at the point of action (reminding them of low risk and value adds). Another example: “Questions? ” in case they need last-minute help before converting.
UI Guidance: Center this section and make it stand out – often a solid background color or even a background image of a team celebrating in their new jerseys could be effective (with a color overlay to keep text readable). However, be cautious that the CTA button contrasts with the background. All text should be succinct; the button is the star here. This section effectively corresponds to the “Action” stage of AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), ensuring the visitor has an easy way to convert after building interest ￼. It’s placed at the end so that anyone who made it through the information above doesn’t have to scroll back up to act. (For mobile users, consider a sticky footer button that is the equivalent of this CTA, so it’s always one tap away ￼.)
	7.	Footer – Lightweight footer with essential links. Since this is a one-page landing for now, the footer should be minimal (to keep focus on the CTA) yet provide standard info for those who seek it:
	•	Company Info: a small copyright line, the company name, perhaps location.
	•	Helpful Links: e.g. FAQ, Contact Us, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Return Policy. These can be in smaller font. Users who scroll to the very bottom often look for these to validate the business’s legitimacy or get support.
	•	Social Media Icons: if relevant, small icons linking to Instagram, Twitter, etc., to show brand presence (this can also build trust, but keep them low-key to avoid distracting a buyer at the last moment).
	•	For B2B: possibly include a contact email/phone for wholesale inquiries here if not highlighted above.
UI Guidance: Use a muted background color (like dark gray or white) and small font for the footer. It should feel like a clear end of the page. The footer content can be center-aligned on mobile and spread out in columns on desktop if needed. The key is that it doesn’t compete with the CTA section; it’s purely for completeness and credibility. This footer is modular – as the site expands, it can grow into a fuller footer with more links or sign-up forms (e.g., newsletter) later.

Why this layout? Each section is deliberately ordered to follow the visitor’s mindset from Attention → Interest → Desire → Action ￼. The Hero grabs attention with a clear value prop, the AI Demo and Features build interest and desire by showing how it works and why it’s great, the Testimonials and targeted solutions deepen desire and trust, and the final CTA triggers the action. This narrative flow is aligned with classic marketing frameworks and top-performing landing page structures, which often start with a value proposition and then layer on benefits and social proof before the call-to-action ￼. Additionally, every module is self-contained (hero, feature list, testimonials, etc.), meaning ProJersey’s team can rearrange or expand them without redesigning the whole page. For example, the “AI Designer” section could later link to a full demo page, or the “For Teams” section could expand into a dedicated Teams page as the site grows. In essence, this modular one-pager “tells the story” of the product through its sections ￼ while remaining flexible for future needs.

Modular Components & Content Order Rationale

Breaking the page into modules ensures each piece of content has a clear purpose and can be optimized independently. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and why they appear in this sequence:
	•	Hero Section: Placed at the top because it must immediately communicate what ProJersey is and why the visitor should care. In conversion optimization, you have only a few seconds to hook the visitor, so a strong hero with a bold headline and CTA is essential ￼. By clearly stating the value proposition (e.g., AI-powered custom jerseys quickly and easily), we address the user’s main question upfront. The hero’s job is to capture Attention and encourage further exploration. It sets the tone (enthusiastic, solution-oriented) and reduces bounce rate by showing a compelling offer right away. Best practices indicate that above-the-fold content should focus on grabbing interest and beginning the engagement, which is exactly what the hero does ￼ ￼.
	•	AI Designer Feature: We introduce the AI design tool early because it’s ProJersey’s differentiator – the innovative hook that can spark Interest. Placing it right after the hero capitalizes on the curiosity we just generated. This module demonstrates how ProJersey is different from other custom jersey options, which helps visitors quickly understand the product’s unique selling point. Showing the tool’s ease-of-use also preemptively addresses a major friction point for users (designing is hard or time-consuming) by proving it’s easy and automated. In a landing page flow, demonstrating key features or the product in action at an early stage keeps the momentum going and prevents drop-off, as the visitor begins to visualize themselves using the service. Visually engaging content here (video/animation) also maintains attention during the scroll.
	•	Features/How-It-Works & Benefits: This component is about providing the supporting details that turn interest into Desire. Once the visitor is intrigued by the AI tool, they will naturally seek more practical information: Can I trust the quality? How does ordering work? What about my specific need (size, shipping, etc.)? Listing features and steps answers these questions in a structured way, which is crucial for conversion. According to best practices, highlighting benefits and reasons to buy is a core function of a landing page ￼. The logic behind the order is that after showing what the product is (hero) and how it basically works (AI demo), we now show why it’s valuable and easy. This reduces uncertainty. Each bullet or step here aims to eliminate a potential hesitation (e.g., “Is it complicated?”, “Will it suit my team?”, “Is it expensive?”) by proactively providing reassuring info. We also include a mid-page CTA here because a sufficiently convinced user shouldn’t have to scroll back up to take action ￼. It’s a gentle prompt that if they’re ready, the path is open. The modular nature of this section means we could expand any of these points into more detail pages later (for example, a full “Pricing” page or “How it works” section), but on the landing page we give just enough to persuade.
	•	Testimonials/Social Proof: This module is strategically placed after the features because once we’ve claimed how good the product is, we need to prove it. Social proof serves as an objective-sounding confirmation that “Yes, this delivers on its promises.” In the hierarchy of persuasion, user testimonials and reviews are powerful in nudging those on the fence. We put it after the core benefits because readers will better appreciate testimonials once they know what the product is; a quote saying “ProJersey was amazing for my team” carries more weight when the visitor already understands what ProJersey does. It directly addresses the trust factor: nearly 9 in 10 people read reviews before a purchase ￼, so including them is known to improve conversion rates. For B2B visitors, seeing another business endorse the platform can be a tipping point as well ￼. Thus, the logic is to solidify Desire and trust right before the final call to action. This module is also easily updatable – as ProJersey gains more clients, new testimonials or logos can be swapped in without altering the page structure.
	•	Audience-Specific Sections (Teams & B2B): We carved out this just before the final CTA (interwoven around the testimonial section, either just before or just after it, depending on design flow) to directly speak to segment needs. The rationale is that specialized B2B or team buyers might require additional information (volume pricing, roster management, etc.) that general consumers don’t. By placing it in the latter half of the page, we ensure casual individual buyers are not overwhelmed up front, while serious team/coaches or business visitors who are scrolling for specifics will find it. This sequencing allows the page to maintain a coherent story for everyone (AI design → how it works → benefits), and then branch into specifics as needed. In effect, it’s a targeted late-stage pitch: “By the way, if you’re a coach or a reseller, here’s why this is also perfect for you.” It’s proximate to the CTA and testimonials so that these more critical buyers get both the reassurance from social proof and a direct invitation to convert (contact sales or start a team design) almost in one view. Keeping these segments in a separate module also makes it modular – in the future, those could become separate landing pages entirely for “Teams” and “B2B”, but for now they are contained within this page.
	•	Final CTA Section: We repeat the primary call to action at the end because of the well-documented principle that multiple touchpoints for CTA increase conversion opportunity ￼. The logic is simple: after a user has absorbed all this information, we want to channel that into the intended action. This section doesn’t introduce new info; it’s a recap and trigger. Even if someone scrolled quickly, the final CTA catches their eye and reminds them of the next step. It’s also a psychological closure – the page started with an invitation and ends with one, creating a cohesive journey toward conversion. From a modular standpoint, this CTA block can be adjusted with promotions (e.g., “Get 10% off your first order – Design Now”) or A/B tested with different phrasing, without touching the rest of the content. Notably, our CTAs across the page are all driving the same action (start designing or contact for bulk) to maintain a singular conversion goal, as recommended for landing pages ￼ (avoiding mixed objectives).

Overall, the ordering of these components follows a storytelling arc and the marketing AIDA model: first Attention (hero), then Interest (demo/unique feature), then Desire (benefits, proof, specific solutions), and finally Action (CTA) ￼. Each module is crafted to maximize its role (e.g., hero = attention with value prop; features = desire with benefits) in driving the user closer to conversion. By adhering to this structure, we incorporate the “cream of the crop” components of effective landing pages ￼ and ensure nothing is out of place or wasted. Everything the visitor sees is intentionally ordered to answer their likely questions in the sequence they arise and to reduce friction at each step.

Customer Journey Flows for Key User Segments

ProJersey serves distinct types of customers, and each may navigate the page and the conversion process differently. We outline the customer journey flow for an Individual buyer, a Team buyer, and a B2B buyer, noting how the landing page and subsequent steps accommodate each:

1. Individual Buyer Journey (Solo Athlete/Fan)

Persona: An individual athlete or sports fan looking to create a single custom jersey (for themselves or as a gift). They value speed, ease, and assurance of quality since they might be new to custom apparel.

Journey Steps:
	1.	Awareness & Entry: The individual likely finds ProJersey via a social media ad, a Google search for “custom basketball jersey”, or word-of-mouth. Upon clicking the link, they land on the ProJersey single-page site. Immediately, the Hero section’s message “Design Your Dream Jersey with AI” grabs their interest – it sounds fun and easy, which is exactly what they want. The prominent “Start Designing Now” button gives them a clear next step right away.
	2.	Exploration & Inspiration: Before clicking the CTA, they scroll a bit to see what this is about. The AI Designer demo section catches their eye – perhaps there’s an animated preview of a jersey being created. This wow factor convinces them that “I don’t need to be a designer to do this!” and reduces any intimidation. They read the quick blurb that says the AI can come up with designs for them. Feeling intrigued, they may play the demo video or imagine the possibilities for their own jersey (e.g., their name or favorite number on a cool design).
	3.	Evaluating Features: As a cautious shopper, the individual might scan the Features section next for practical details. They see bullet points like “premium quality”, “no minimum order” (important because they just want one item), and “delivered in a week”. This addresses key concerns: Will this jersey be legit? Can I just order one? How long will it take? All those answers are right there, increasing their confidence to proceed. Seeing a step-by-step of how it works also reassures them that the process is straightforward (choose template, customize, order – they can do that).
	4.	First CTA Interaction: At this point, the individual is likely convinced enough to try the tool. They click the “Start Designing Now” CTA (either in the hero or the mid-page one). This action could launch the AI design interface or prompt a quick sign-up if required (ideally a light sign-up or guest mode to reduce friction).
	5.	Design Phase: Inside the jersey designer, the user follows on-screen prompts – e.g., selects their sport, enters a team name or favorite colors for the AI to generate designs. The AI presents a few design mockups. The user picks one and perhaps customizes it further (changes a color, adds their name “Jackson” on back and number “23”). The UX here is key: for desktop, it’s a rich interactive canvas; on mobile, maybe a simplified step-wise interface. The individual enjoys tweaking the design, and seeing an instant 3D preview gives them excitement – “This looks awesome and it was so easy!”. This positive interaction is crucial in the journey; it delivers the core value that was promised.
	6.	Cart & Purchase: Satisfied with the design, the individual proceeds to the order. They select their size, see the price update (for one jersey, perhaps $X). Because they saw earlier mention of “100% satisfaction guarantee” and perhaps a testimonial, they feel safe buying. The checkout process (shipping info, payment) should be smooth and optimized for either desktop or mobile input. They complete the purchase and receive a confirmation that their custom jersey is being made.
	7.	Post-Purchase & Follow-up: The individual receives email updates (order confirmation, shipping tracking). The landing page journey technically ended at conversion, but it’s worth noting that post-purchase, they might be invited to share their design on social media or refer friends (common D2C tactics). If their experience is good, they might return to the site (now familiar) to create another design or tell teammates. In future, the site could retain their design in an account profile, making re-orders easy (e.g., they might later order matching shorts or another jersey with a different color).

Touchpoints on Page: The individual mostly engages with the Hero, AI Demo, and Features sections. Testimonials might play a smaller role but can reinforce trust (e.g., a quote about quality might assure them they’ll like the product). The Team/B2B info is less relevant to them, and they might skip it while scrolling or not even see it if they convert quickly. The key is that nothing on the page alienates or confuses them – the messaging is inclusive enough (e.g., talking about “your jersey” in singular) and the CTAs are aimed at exactly what they want to do. This journey is a short decision cycle – possibly just a few minutes from landing to purchase – so the page’s job is to funnel them quickly with excitement and simplicity. Top D2C sites often cater to impulse or quick decision buys by making the process feel fun and easy, which is what we replicate.

2. Team Buyer Journey (Coach/Manager for a Group)

Persona: A coach, team manager, or team captain tasked with ordering uniforms for the whole team. They might have 15-20 players and need a cohesive design with different names/numbers on each. They care about consistency, price per jersey, and an easy way to collect info for each player. They may also be budget-conscious (team funds) and time-constrained (season starting soon).

Journey Steps:
	1.	Awareness & Entry: The team buyer may discover ProJersey via a search like “custom team uniforms bulk” or from seeing another team use it. Perhaps ProJersey ran a targeted ad in a coaches’ Facebook group, or the user found a blog post about “easy uniform design”. Upon landing on the page, the Hero section appeals to them but in a slightly different way: the headline speaks about designing jerseys easily – that’s interesting because it promises to save them hassle. They notice in the subheadline or somewhere that “for teams and clubs” is mentioned. The hero image might show not just a single jersey but a team, which resonates with their goal. The “Start Designing” CTA is inviting, but they hold off clicking immediately; they want to “read a bit first” (typical of someone handling a group order, they’ll be a bit more careful).
	2.	Scrolling for Specifics: The team buyer scrolls through the AI Demo section – they find the concept neat but they are also asking “Can this handle my whole team’s needs?”. When they reach the Features/How-It-Works, they pay attention to anything about multiple jerseys. They see “Add all your players in one go” or “Bulk order discounts” in the bullet points, which is exactly their concern. This gives them confidence that the platform is designed for team orders, not just single custom t-shirts. The step-by-step might even explicitly show a step for adding team member names and sizes. This is reassuring and peaks their Interest/Desire because they imagine how much easier this is than coordinating via email and spreadsheets as they usually do.
	3.	Team Section Engagement: The dedicated “For Teams” section really grabs their focus. Here, the copy speaks directly to them: e.g., “Upload your roster and each jersey will be personalized in one click.” They might think, “Great, I have an excel of my players – I can use that.” The mention of “team discount” makes them happy because cost is a factor – they might have gotten quotes from local sports shops that were high or required minimum orders of 20+. Seeing “no minimums” or “discount after 10 pieces” clearly stated removes a potential barrier to contacting or trying this service. They might also note if there’s a line like “Need help? Talk to our team outfitting specialist.” If a phone number or chat is provided here, a cautious coach might actually reach out with a quick question (ensure that contact option is visible for those who prefer it).
	4.	CTA – Starting a Team Design: Armed with the info that ProJersey can handle a team, the buyer is likely to click “Start Designing” or perhaps a special CTA like “Design for Your Team” in the team section. This could lead them into the same design interface, but possibly with an initial prompt: “Designing for a team? You’ll be able to add multiple players and sizes after creating your jersey design.” Such messaging sets expectations. They proceed to design a base jersey (perhaps choosing colors and a design with the AI). After finalizing the look, the platform invites them to “Add Team Details” – a step where they enter each player’s name, number, and select a size for each. The UX might provide a simple table for this, which is a huge convenience for them.
	5.	Team Order Configuration: The coach enters all 15 names/numbers, selects quantities (mostly 1 each, unless they order extras). The system shows a summary: 15 jerseys, assorted sizes, design X. The price per jersey might have automatically dropped due to quantity, which pleasantly surprises them if, for example, they see “Bulk discount applied”. This transparency in pricing and ease of configuration increases their satisfaction – no need to call a sales rep for a quote; it’s right there and it’s fair. If any uncertainty remains (say one player’s info is missing), they know they can save and come back or quickly adjust. A save cart or share design link feature would be valuable here, since sometimes team decisions involve checking with someone else (maybe the club treasurer or to show the design to the team). Ideally, ProJersey allows them to save the design or cart (perhaps via creating an account if not already) so they can resume.
	6.	Approval & Purchase: The team buyer might take a short pause – perhaps they want to run the design by the team or ensure sizes are correct. The platform could facilitate this (for instance, a generated link or PDF proof of the design to share). Once ready, they complete the purchase: 15 jerseys x $price, plus any customization fees if applicable, etc. The checkout might be done via an invoice or just online payment. They choose shipping to ensure it arrives by their needed date (if timing is tight, maybe they choose expedited). Throughout, the site’s UX (both desktop and mobile) should handle the complexity smoothly – no crashes with 15 items in cart, etc. A progress indicator or summary helps them feel in control.
	7.	Post-Purchase: The coach gets a confirmation and likely relief that this major task (getting uniforms) is handled. They might receive an email with all the details they input (names, sizes) as record. Over the next days, ProJersey keeps them updated. The jerseys arrive, and hopefully exceed expectations. This positive outcome will make the coach a repeat user next season or for other teams. The landing page has essentially converted them not just into a one-time buyer but potentially an advocate (maybe leaving a testimonial or recommending the service to peer coaches).

Touchpoints on Page: The team buyer interacts with more sections than the individual. They read Hero, Features, Team-specific section, and likely glance at Testimonials (particularly looking for any from other teams). A testimonial like “Our whole club loves the new uniforms” will resonate strongly. They might not care about the B2B portion (unless they also have a business), but its presence signals robustness. Importantly, the content flow answered their specific questions: “Can I do bulk? How to add names? Is there a discount?” without them having to hunt or leave the page. The journey took longer than an individual’s – they might spend 10-15 minutes between reading and using the tool, possibly with a short break to confirm things. The modular content supports this by being easy to scan (they found the “Teams” info easily due to clear headings), and the CTA they clicked possibly had team context. This journey emphasizes how the page can cater to a more complex decision that involves planning, not just impulse – aligning with the notion that B2C might be quick while “small group B2B” (teams) is a bit more considered. In the end, the team buyer’s needs for coordination, pricing, and trust were met through targeted content and features.

3. B2B Buyer Journey (Bulk Reseller/Distributor or Enterprise Client)

Persona: A B2B buyer could be a sporting goods retailer wanting to offer custom jerseys to their customers, an event organizer needing a bulk order of jerseys for all teams in a tournament, or perhaps a corporate client ordering jerseys for a company league. This persona thinks in terms of volume, cost efficiency, integration, and reliability. They often require a deeper level of trust before committing, and their “purchase” might be a longer process (RFQs, procurement approvals).

Journey Steps:
	1.	Awareness & Entry: Such buyers might find ProJersey through industry networks, trade shows, or targeted outbound (maybe an email or LinkedIn outreach by ProJersey). It’s also possible they came via the website’s contact form after hearing of the service. If they hit the landing page, the Hero needs to assure them that ProJersey is not just a consumer toy but a serious fulfillment platform. The headline “AI-Powered Sports Kit Fulfillment” and images of jerseys might catch their eye, but they will be reading between the lines for business viability. They likely scroll almost immediately to see if there’s content relevant to businesses (the hero’s secondary CTA like “Bulk Inquiries” might even draw their attention and they could click it to jump to the B2B section).
	2.	Assessing Credibility: A B2B buyer will scan for signs of professionalism and capability. They look at the Features section and note things like “high-volume production” or “enterprise support”. They pay attention to any metrics if provided (e.g., “5000+ jerseys delivered” or “10K jerseys per month capacity”). If the landing page has logos of other companies or organizations, they take note, as that is social proof in their language. They might briefly watch the AI demo out of curiosity, but their mindset is more about outcomes and partnership than the novelty of design. They likely scroll to the B2B-specific section fairly quickly to answer their burning questions.
	3.	B2B Section & Info Gathering: In the “For Businesses & Resellers” segment, the buyer finds what they need: bullet points about wholesale pricing and possibly an offer to connect with an account manager. This is where they might slow down and read carefully. For example, they see “Dedicated account managers for bulk clients” – a sign of white-glove service, which they often expect. “API integration available” or “White-label packaging” might be mentioned if relevant – these could be icing on the cake for them. They might also see a line like “Trusted supplier for [X] league or [Y] retail chain”, which boosts confidence. The presence of a phone number or a clear “Contact Sales” button here is critical – many B2B buyers prefer to talk to a human or get a formal quote rather than clicking “Start Designing.” At this point, the likely next step for them is to reach out rather than immediately use the design tool, especially if their order is in the hundreds or they have custom requirements.
	4.	Engaging with Sales (Conversion for B2B): The B2B buyer clicks “Contact Us for Bulk Orders” (or maybe they call a provided number). Suppose it’s a form: they fill in their details, maybe specifying “I need 200 jerseys for a league, by X date.” This is their conversion event on the landing page – essentially lead capture. After submitting, the page or subsequent communication might indicate “Thank you, our B2B specialist will reach out within 1 business day.” They might not have purchased anything yet, but this is the success metric for B2B: capturing a qualified lead. If the site instead prompted an email, they would send an email or expect one.
	5.	Follow-up Process: Off the page, the journey continues with a sales representative contacting them, providing tailored info, maybe a demo or a sample. The buyer might request to see sample designs or physical quality proofs. ProJersey might even offer to create a custom prototype jersey via the AI tool and send it to them – a strategy to win the deal. Eventually, negotiations on price and terms occur. Perhaps the buyer decides to make a pilot order of 50 jerseys. They might actually come back to the ProJersey platform to finalize design (the sales rep could give them a direct link to an advanced design interface or set up a template for them to approve). The actual ordering for B2B might be done through a special portal or manually by ProJersey staff after agreement. In any case, the landing page’s job was done once it secured the contact – the rest is account management.
	6.	Long-term Relationship: If all goes well, the B2B client becomes a recurring customer. They might get a login to a bulk-order portal or simply continue liaising with their account manager for new orders. The landing page might not see them often after the first interaction, except if they refer others or if the company has a policy where different people check the website for info. Ensuring the site always reflects professional, up-to-date information is important for any future visits by such clients.

Touchpoints on Page: The B2B buyer is most influenced by the Team/B2B section, Testimonials, and overall professional feel. They likely skim the top, possibly ignoring some consumer-centric language, until they find the part that speaks to them. If there’s a testimonial from a business (e.g., retailer), that will stand out to them. They might also notice if any language in the hero or features addresses “bulk orders” or “scalable”. A particularly cautious B2B buyer might even check the footer for a physical address or Terms of Service to verify the company’s legitimacy and policies (for example, they might look at return policy for defects on large orders, etc.). Compared to the individual and team journeys, the B2B journey on-site is shorter in actions (they mostly gather info and fill a form) but longer in decision timeline (their actual purchase comes later). The landing page is more of a lead generator for them. It must reassure them with content that aligns to B2B best practices: a clear value proposition for businesses, evidence of competence, and an easy path to talk to a real person ￼ ￼. We’ve integrated those elements so that when a B2B visitor lands, they quickly see “Yes, this platform can handle my scale and I can contact them directly to discuss details”, leading to a successful conversion of that lead.

UX Considerations for Mobile vs. Desktop

Designing for both mobile and desktop is crucial for ProJersey’s landing page, as different users may access it from different devices. The experience should be responsive and optimized for each, ensuring consistency in content but tailoring layout and interactions to the screen size and input method. Here are key UX considerations for mobile versus desktop:
	•	Responsive Layout & Content Prioritization: On desktop, we can utilize multi-column layouts (e.g., text beside image) and more whitespace, whereas on mobile the design should switch to single-column stacking for readability. Each section of the wireframe will collapse vertically on mobile. For example, in the hero on desktop the CTA might sit beside an image, but on mobile the image may appear full-width below the headline or as a background with the headline over it. We must ensure that no content is lost between versions – all essential information on desktop should be accessible on mobile ￼. However, we might prioritize some content differently: mobile users have less patience for long text, so we might use accordions for FAQs or truncate testimonials with a “read more” on mobile to save space. The design should be mobile-first in the sense that we start with a clean, simple layout that then expands for desktop, not the other way around (to avoid mobile feeling like an afterthought). This approach also benefits SEO and loading speed on mobile, which Google rewards ￼.
	•	Navigation & Access: Likely the landing page has minimal navigation, but if there is a menu (say links to “How it Works, Testimonials, Contact”), on desktop this could appear as a top bar. On mobile, it should condense into a hamburger menu. Given it’s a one-pager, tapping menu items could scroll to that section (anchor links). Ensure that tapping the menu is easy (finger-size targets). Also, make the CTA always accessible: On desktop, the CTA buttons are visible at various scroll points; on mobile, because of longer scroll, consider a sticky CTA bar at the bottom of the screen (“Design Now” button that’s always visible) for convenience. This sticky mobile CTA should be small enough not to intrude but present so that users don’t have to scroll up/down to find a way to start (given attention spans are short on phones).
	•	Touch-friendly UI Elements: Mobile UX means designing for fingers, not mouse clicks. Buttons like the CTA need to be large enough to tap without error, and spaced to avoid accidental taps. The carousel for testimonials (if implemented) must allow swipe gestures. Any interactive element (like the AI design demo or product configurator) should be adjusted: e.g., on desktop maybe you hover to see a jersey rotate; on mobile, that might need to be a tap or just a static image (since hover doesn’t exist on touch screens). Form fields (like the contact form or team roster upload) should use mobile-friendly inputs (proper keyboard types for email/number, etc., and big tap targets for checkboxes). We also must adhere to accessibility: font sizes should adjust (no tiny text on mobile), and color contrast remains strong on small screens ￼.
	•	Media and Performance: Mobile devices often have slower connections, so optimize images and media. Use compressed images and maybe avoid auto-play videos on mobile (give user control to play to save their data). Perhaps use a static image instead of a video background on mobile. Lazy-load images as the user scrolls to them to improve initial load. Also, consider different image cropping: a wide desktop image might need to be a taller cropped image on mobile to show the subject properly. Testing the speed on mobile is vital – a fast-loading mobile page keeps users from bouncing. We should aim to keep the page lean; for instance, the fancy AI demo might be a lighter version on mobile (or a call to “try it” that opens the actual tool, rather than embedding a heavy interactive element in the page).
	•	Interaction differences (Design Tool): A major consideration is the jersey design interface on mobile vs desktop. On desktop, users have the benefit of a large screen, drag-and-drop, maybe seeing multiple options at once. On mobile, the UI should likely present one step at a time. For example, first choose the template, then next screen to choose colors, then next to add text, etc., using a wizard-like flow. The customer journey for individuals/teams should remain smooth on mobile – if it’s too fiddly to customize on a phone, provide an option like “send me a link to design on a larger screen” or allow them to save a design draft. In fact, recognizing cross-device behavior is important: users might browse on mobile and later finish on desktop ￼. Providing continuity (like logging in to save progress, or emailing themselves the design) is a good UX touch for these multi-device scenarios. For example, a team coach might start the design on their phone at practice, then finalize on their work laptop later. Ensuring the platform supports that (same account, same design) creates a seamless experience.
	•	Consistency & Content Parity: It’s important that the mobile page contains all the persuasive elements of the desktop page: hero message, CTAs, benefits, testimonials, etc., just formatted differently. A mobile user should get the same value proposition and information, without feeling something is “missing”. At the same time, we may collapse less critical content. For instance, on desktop we might show three testimonial quotes side by side; on mobile it becomes a swipe carousel or just stacked vertically. The B2B section on desktop might use a two-column format with “Teams” and “Business” side by side; on mobile, they’ll be one after the other – we should consider the order (likely Teams first, then Business) and maybe add a subtle separator so users realize they’re distinct topics.
	•	Testing and Accessibility: We should test the design with actual devices to ensure things like text fit on small screens (no cut-offs) and that interactions like the roster upload work (maybe allow import from phone storage, etc.). Also, design with one-hand use in mind – many mobile users will use their thumb. So, critical buttons like CTA should ideally be within easy reach (lower half of the screen) ￼. This suggests the idea of a bottom placement or sticky footer CTA for mobile, as mentioned. Additionally, ensure all tap targets meet guidelines (Apple and Google recommend at least 44px tall buttons, for example) ￼.
	•	Desktop Enhancements: On the flipside, for desktop we can enhance the experience with additional visuals or interactive content since we have more screen real estate and cursor precision. For example, the hero could have a subtle animation (maybe a looping video of different jersey designs) that might be too heavy for mobile. Desktop can show an expanded navigation (like anchor links to sections) to facilitate quick jumps, whereas mobile relies on scrolling. We should ensure the desktop view doesn’t become too “sparse” due to our mobile-first simplicity – use the space to maybe add background graphics or side-by-side content blocks that make the page feel full and engaging. However, we must avoid falling into the trap of overloading desktop such that it becomes “overly dispersed across long scrolling pages” ￼. Striking the right balance is key: both versions should be concise and focused, just presented differently.

In summary, the design will be fully responsive, offering a cohesive experience whether someone visits from a phone on the go or a desktop at the office. The core message and CTAs remain consistent ￼. Mobile users get a streamlined interface with large buttons and perhaps fewer simultaneous options (to avoid overwhelm on a small screen), while desktop users benefit from richer visuals and multi-column layouts. Importantly, any critical action (starting a design, contacting sales, checking out) will be just as doable on mobile as on desktop – there should be no “please use a desktop to do this” roadblock, since that could turn away many individual consumers. By planning for the entire digital experience across devices, we ensure higher conversion and satisfaction regardless of how the user accesses the landing page.

Best Practices from Top-Performing D2C & B2B Pages Applied

In crafting ProJersey’s landing page strategy, we’ve incorporated proven best practices observed in high-converting direct-to-consumer (D2C) and business-to-business (B2B) product landing pages:
	•	Clear Value Proposition & Hero Focus: Successful D2C and B2B pages always communicate a clear value prop in the hero section ￼ ￼. We applied this by making the headline immediately tell what ProJersey offers (AI-assisted custom jerseys) and why it’s beneficial (quick, easy, pro-quality). This aligns with best practices to hook the visitor with a unique benefit right away, as well as B2B advice to target the client’s pain point with a solution in the headline ￼.
	•	Strong Visuals and Design Simplicity: Top landing pages use eye-catching visuals to support the message ￼ – for example, showing the product in action. We’ve included dynamic images of the jersey design process and final product to make the page engaging. At the same time, we kept the layout modular and clean, avoiding clutter or overly long text blocks that could cause “eye strain” and high bounce rates ￼. Each section has a clear purpose and is visually separated, which is a common trait in effective designs.
	•	Engaging, Benefit-Oriented Copy: Rather than generic text, we use copy that speaks to the visitor’s aspirations and concerns (e.g., “design in seconds,” “no hassle,” “professional quality”). Leading D2C brands use emotional and benefit-driven language to persuade ￼, and B2B pages use concise yet informative text that doesn’t shy from specifics ￼. We balanced both by keeping the tone generally upbeat and accessible (for individuals) while also including the more specific value points (for teams/business, like “volume discounts,” “account manager”) that B2B audiences expect.
	•	Social Proof Integration: Both D2C and B2B pages see higher conversion when they incorporate testimonials, reviews, or client logos as social proof ￼ ￼. We made testimonials a key module, showcasing trust signals for each audience segment. This mirrors what top pages do – for instance, D2C sites often show customer quotes or star ratings prominently, and B2B sites include client success stories or usage statistics to build credibility.
	•	Multiple CTAs & Single Goal: A known best practice is to have a single conversion goal for a landing page (e.g., purchase or sign-up) but provide multiple opportunities (buttons) to achieve it ￼. We applied this by keeping our primary CTA action (“Start Designing” or contacting sales) consistent throughout, while repeating it at strategic points (top, mid, bottom). We also respected the guideline of not introducing conflicting CTAs. Even though we have secondary paths for different user types, they ultimately funnel into the same conversion funnel – either designing (which leads to purchase) or contacting sales. B2B experts suggest one clear CTA and even minimizing navigation to reduce distraction ￼, which we followed by using a prominent CTA and a very light nav/footer.
	•	Competitor Differentiation: High-converting pages often preemptively address “Why choose us over others?” perhaps via comparison tables or bold statements ￼. We included elements of differentiation (AI vs traditional design methods, no minimums vs competitors requiring bulk, etc.) in our content. By subtly weaving in those comparisons, we follow the practice of letting visitors know ProJersey’s unique advantages, increasing their confidence in choosing us.
	•	Urgency and FOMO (where appropriate): Many top D2C landing pages use urgency or exclusive offers to push immediate action ￼. While our plan doesn’t heavily rely on limited-time offers (since custom jerseys are a considered purchase), we could incorporate subtle urgency in future – for example, a banner like “Order now to get your jerseys by the season start!” or seasonal promotions. We mention this as a potential enhancement because using genuine urgency can improve conversion if applicable ￼. For now, the focus is on the core product, but the modular design allows adding such banners or promo sections later without restructuring the page.
	•	Trust and Assurance Elements: Best-in-class pages include trust badges, guarantees, or clear policies (like free returns, secure checkout) to reduce purchase anxiety. We echoed this by suggesting inclusion of satisfaction guarantee notes and ensuring critical info (like terms and contact) are present in the footer. B2B buyers also look for signs of reliability (like seeing a privacy policy if they fill a form, etc.), so having those links readily available is a subtle best practice to build trust.
	•	AIDA Structure and Storytelling: Many effective landing pages implicitly follow the AIDA model, leading the user through a narrative ￼. We explicitly structured our page in this flow (Attention – Hero, Interest – AI Demo, Desire – Features/Proof, Action – CTA) ￼. By doing so, we’re aligning with a century-old marketing principle that’s still relevant in digital design ￼ – guiding the user step by step to conversion. Each section of our wireframe corresponds to a phase of this model, ensuring we’re not missing any psychological step a customer needs to take before buying.
	•	Modularity for Testing and Expansion: Top landing pages often iterate through A/B testing different sections or orders. Because our design is modular, it’s easy to test changes – for instance, trying a different headline, or swapping the order of testimonials and the team section – without rebuilding the whole page. This flexibility is a best practice from a development standpoint (as noted by modular design approaches ￼ ￼). It also means as ProJersey grows, the landing page can evolve (maybe splitting into multiple targeted landing pages for each segment) using the same building blocks. Reusability and consistency in these modules ensure the brand message stays unified even as we tailor to audiences.

By incorporating these best practices, the ProJersey landing page is set up to be conversion-focused and user-friendly. It leverages what’s been proven to work for other D2C e-commerce pages – like compelling visuals, benefit-led copy, and social proof – and what works for B2B pages – like clear value messaging, informative content, and straightforward CTAs to contact or learn more. Each design decision from layout to wording has been informed by these high-performing strategies, giving ProJersey a strong foundation for both immediate results and future growth.
