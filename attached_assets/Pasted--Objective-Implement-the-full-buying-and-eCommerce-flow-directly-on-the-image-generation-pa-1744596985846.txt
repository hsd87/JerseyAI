🎯 Objective:
Implement the **full buying and eCommerce flow** directly on the **image generation page** of the ProJersey platform. This includes post-generation editing, product configuration, cart logic, team roster input, pricing, and checkout handling.

🧩 Scope of Work:

🔹 1. 🖼️ Design Page Flow

Ensure the entire flow happens in a single interactive view (react component-based):

- **[Step 1]** 🧾 Form Input → 🧠 ChatGPT Prompt → 🖼️ Image Generation  
- **[Step 2]** Canvas Editing (Logo/Name/Number placement)  
- **[Step 3]** Product Configuration + Add-ons + Pricing  
- **[Step 4]** Team Roster / Sizing  
- **[Step 5]** Checkout Page → Summary + PDF → Payment

🔹 2. 🧰 Implement Functional Blocks

### A. Canvas Editor (after image is generated)
- Allow users to upload logo (PNG/JPEG/SVG) and place it (drag to move, pinch/slider to resize).
- Allow input for player name and number (e.g., text fields shown above image) and dynamically overlay them.
- Save updated state to backend or as metadata to include in PDF & order.

### B. Add-On Product Selection (shown below image editor)
- Show complementary product blocks:
  - Matching Socks → $6  
  - Matching Beanie/Headband → $10  
  - Matching Tracksuit → $25  
  - Matching Kit Bag / Backpack → $18
- Each product:
  - ✅ Checkbox or “Add to Cart” toggle
  - 🧾 Price display
  - Optional thumbnail (ref image)
- Save selected add-ons to order object.

### C. Size Chart Toggle (Reusable Modal/Section)
- Implement a size chart modal or dropdown that toggles open for Male, Female, Youth.
- Load pre-defined sizing charts based on sport (can be hardcoded or pulled from static JSON).
- Make it accessible before filling the roster.

🔹 3. 🧮 Price Calculator

Dynamic total price updates based on:
- Base kit type (jersey only / jersey + shorts / full kit, etc.)
- Add-ons selected
- Team size (unit price x qty)
- Subscription discount (if user is Pro subscriber → apply 15% discount)
- Live display:
  - Unit Price
  - Quantity
  - Subtotal
  - Add-ons total
  - Final Total (post-discount)

---

🔹 4. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team/Individual Roster Input

Create a flexible component:
- **Switch** between:
  - Individual Order (simple name/number/size/qty)
  - Team Order (table input)
- Table Columns:
  - Player Name
  - Number
  - Size (Dropdown from size chart)
  - Quantity (default 1)
- Allow + / – row addition
- Validate for completeness before allowing checkout

🔹 5. 📦 Order Summary + Checkout Integration

  - Store order in DB with:
    - Design metadata
    - Roster
    - Add-ons

📱 UI Guidance:
- Keep layout scroll-friendly, sectioned using anchors:
  - “Your Design”, “Add Customization”, “Add-ons”, “Sizing”, “Roster”, “Checkout”
- Highlight Total Price as sticky footer element on mobile
- Use cards with icons for add-ons, clean table input for roster
- Primary CTA: “Proceed to Checkout” visible at all times

A complete on-page ordering system turning image generation into a personalized, monetizable eCommerce flow — seamlessly integrating creative, customization, and purchasing without jumping between views.
