I'll implement the full Stripe payment and subscription flow with user state tracking as requested. Let's work on each part systematically.

First, let's create the useSubscriptionStore to manage subscription state:


Created client/src/hooks/use-subscription-store.ts
Now let's add the subscription status endpoint to the backend:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now, let's update App.tsx to load the subscription data when the app starts:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
We need to import the useSubscription hook in App.tsx:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Let's fix our subscription store as we need to update the way we use hooks outside of component context:


Edited client/src/hooks/use-subscription-store.ts
Now let's modify the App.tsx to correctly fetch subscription status when a user is logged in:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
We're encountering a hook ordering issue. Let's simplify the approach by moving the subscription fetching logic to a separate component:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Let's update our navbar component to show subscription status:


Opened client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
Let's update the navbar to show subscription status:


Edited client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
I've been implementing the subscription-related features as requested. Looking at my progress:

✓ Created useSubscriptionStore hook in client/src/hooks/use-subscription-store.ts
✓ Added /api/subscription/status route to backend
✓ Updated App.tsx to fetch subscription status on mount
→ Working on adding subscription status badge to navbar

I'm making good progress on connecting the Stripe payment flow with user state tracking. I'll continue implementing the remaining components and connecting everything together.

It looks like we're encountering an infinite update issue. Let's fix a few issues one by one to resolve this problem.

First, let's fix the infinite update loop in our subscription store and App component:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now let's fix the DOM nesting issue in navbar and add the subscription badge:


Edited client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
Now let's fix the DOM nesting issue in the Navbar by updating the Link components:


Edited client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
Now let's fix the mobile navigation as well:


Edited client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
Let's also add a "Upgrade to Pro" button in the desktop navbar for non-subscribed users:


Edited client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
Now, let's add subscription information to the design form to show the remaining designs:


Opened client/src/components/design-form.tsx
Now let's update the DesignForm to use the subscription info from the subscription store:


Edited client/src/components/design-form.tsx
Now let's update the DesignForm to use the updated subscription information:


Edited client/src/components/design-form.tsx
Now let's update the UI elements in the DesignForm to use the subscription data:


Edited client/src/components/design-form.tsx
Let's modify the design form to disable the generate button if the user is out of generations and not subscribed:


Edited client/src/components/design-form.tsx
I've been analyzing my progress so far:

✓ Updated App.tsx to properly fetch and manage subscription status
✓ Enhanced Navbar to display subscription badges for Pro users
✓ Added "Upgrade" button for non-subscribers
✓ Updated DesignForm to show remaining designs count
✓ Implemented conditional disabling of generate button based on subscription status

I'm making good progress implementing the subscription system UI and connecting all components. Next, I'll continue working on finalizing the subscription flow and ensuring all subscription-related UI elements are properly connected.

Enhance user experience by integrating subscription management and improved design generation controls.
Looking at the error in the console, we still have a DOM nesting issue in our Footer component. Let's fix that and finish implementing our subscription-related functionality.


Opened client/src/components/layout/footer.tsx
Let's fix the Link component in the footer to avoid the DOM nesting issue:


Edited client/src/components/layout/footer.tsx
Now let's check our subscribe-page.tsx to ensure it's getting the subscription status correctly:


Opened client/src/pages/subscribe-page.tsx
Now let's update the subscribe page to use our subscription store instead of relying on the user object:


Edited client/src/pages/subscribe-page.tsx
Now let's update the subscribe page to use the subscription store data:


Edited client/src/pages/subscribe-page.tsx
Now let's also update the dependency list in the useEffect to include the subscription:


Edited client/src/pages/subscribe-page.tsx
Now let's make sure we update the subscription status after the payment is successful. Let's modify the SubscriptionForm component:


Edited client/src/pages/subscribe-page.tsx
Let's update the payment success handling to fetch the new subscription status:


Edited client/src/pages/subscribe-page.tsx
Let's create a quick check to see if we need to update the Navbar to show the subscription status. Let's view it first:


Opened client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx
Perfect! The Navbar is already set up to use the useSubscription hook and display the user's subscription status correctly.

Let's check our subscribe-page.tsx file for TypeScript errors with the clientSecret type:


Edited client/src/pages/subscribe-page.tsx
I've been analyzing my progress on the ProJersey project:

✓ Updated DesignForm to integrate subscription information
✓ Fixed Link component usage in DesignForm and Footer
✓ Enhanced SubscribePage to check subscription status
✓ Improved payment flow with proper subscription status updates
→ Finalizing subscription integration across UI components

I'm making good progress implementing the subscription system. All subscription-related UI components are being properly connected, and I'm ensuring proper state management throughout the application.

Improve subscription flow by adding payment success handling and redirecting to the dashboard.
Looks like you're making good progress! I see the app is running and correctly handling user authentication.

Looking at the workflow logs, we can see the server is properly serving content on port 5000, and the authentication system is correctly returning 401 responses for unauthorized requests to /api/user.

I just fixed a few issues to make sure the subscription flow works smoothly:

Fixed the DOM nesting issue in the Footer component (Link with nested <a> tag)
Updated the SubscribePage to use the subscription store for better state management
Enhanced the payment confirmation process to update subscription status immediately after successful payment
Fixed TypeScript errors with the Stripe Elements options
Is there anything specific you'd like me to focus on next? The subscription system seems to be well-integrated now, with proper UI components showing the subscription status, remaining designs, and payment flow.
