A pfsoccerkit, displayed in two cleanly aligned angles: front view (left) and back view (right), against a crisp white studio background. The soccer jersey and shorts are presented in a floating, mannequin-free layout, suitable for high-end product catalog visuals. Both views are perfectly centered, evenly spaced, and fully visible. No cleats, socks, or models ‚Äî just the uniform, front and back.

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Garment Structure

The kit consists of a short-sleeved soccer jersey and tapered mid-thigh athletic shorts. The jersey features a hybrid mandarin V-collar, angular shoulder seams, and a form-fitting streamlined cut through the torso. The shorts include sculpted side panels, a reinforced waistband, and slit hems for dynamic movement.

üßµ Fabric & Texture

Constructed from a dual-zone poly-elastane blend, the jersey incorporates diamond-knit mesh on the torso and smooth matte spandex sleeves. Side panels are embedded with vented hex-weave textures. The material has a low-luster finish, designed to reflect controlled lighting and rich color. Seams are bonded and flatlocked, with detail piping following panel boundaries.

üé® Design Language

The front of the jersey features an elegant yet modern circuit crest pattern, radiating outward from the chest center in metallic gold, resembling a digital royal emblem. Thin plum contour lines wrap along the ribs and upper chest in a tech-circuit geometry. A sharp white slash element cuts diagonally across the midsection, forming a bold angle that intersects the crest motif. Sleeve cuffs are trimmed in metallic gold with subtle dotted patterns near the hem.

The back of the jersey includes a gold vertical spine pattern, composed of interlocking circuit bands. The player name is positioned just below the collar in clean uppercase text, with the number centered mid-back in large gold numerals outlined in white. A deep purple halo gradient behind the number adds tonal contrast.

ü©≥ Shorts Design

Shorts are regal purple with angular gold side panels, shaped like descending wedges that taper toward the knee. A thin white trim outlines the bottom hem and side slits. Rear panel shaping follows the glute contour with internal stitching and a slight back yoke drop. The left thigh displays a gold team crest; the right thigh features an optional player number or minimal icon.
