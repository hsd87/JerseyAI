You are creating a new page titled **FAQs & Help** for the OKDIO/VORO platform.

The goal is to answer common questions and provide quick help for new customers, bulk buyers, and anyone using the AI designer.

🛠 Only generate layout and styling using Tailwind CSS or existing project styles. Do NOT modify core app logic or backend functionality.

📄 PAGE STRUCTURE:

### 1. Hero Header Section
- Heading: `FAQs & Help`
- Subheading:  
  “Got questions? We've got answers. Find everything you need to confidently design and order your custom kit.”
- Layout: Centered, padding `py-16`, background `bg-gray-50`

### 2. Accordion-Based FAQ Section (Stacked or Expandable Items)

#### Format:
Each item should be collapsible. Use Tailwind’s disclosure logic or provide basic layout structure for future enhancement.

**Example FAQs:**

1. **How long does it take to receive my order?**  
   “Most orders are delivered within 12–18 days depending on your location and order size.”

2. **Can I change my kit design after generating it?**  
   “You can edit your design and re-generate it as many times as you like before placing your order.”

3. **Is there a minimum quantity for team orders?**  
   “No. We support single orders and bulk orders with quantity-based pricing.”

4. **What sports do you support?**  
   “Currently: Soccer, Rugby, Basketball, Cricket, Esports, American Football. More coming soon.”

5. **Do you offer refunds or revisions?**  
   “Once your kit is confirmed and manufactured, we cannot refund. However, you can regenerate your design before confirming your order.”
