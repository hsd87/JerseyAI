# ProJersey eCommerce System Analysis

## System Overview

ProJersey is an AI-powered jersey design and ordering platform with the following key components:

1. **Design System**
   - AI-powered jersey design generator using OpenAI for prompt enhancement
   - Replicate API integration for image generation
   - Interactive customization interface
   
2. **Order Management**
   - Dynamic pricing based on order details
   - Team and individual order workflows
   - Package options (jersey only, full kit, etc.)
   
3. **eCommerce Flow**
   - Cart management
   - Checkout process
   - Stripe payment integration
   - Order confirmation

4. **Subscription Model**
   - Free tier: 6 designs/month
   - Premium tier: $9.99/month for unlimited designs
   - Subscription discount integration with order pricing

## Current Issues

### 1. Payment Processing

- **"Cart is empty" error**: The server correctly validates that items array should not be empty, but the client wasn't handling this properly.
- **Stripe API key configuration**: The system is using an invalid Stripe API key format (appears to be a live key).
- **Error handling**: Limited user-friendly error messages for payment failures.

### 2. Order Flow

- **Price calculation errors**: "Failed to update price breakdown" errors in console.
- **Add to cart validation**: Needs more robust validation.
- **Checkout process**: The checkout page needs better state management for handling empty carts.

### 3. System Integration

- **Authentication/Order connection**: Order creation requires authentication but handles failures poorly.
- **Subscription benefits**: Discount application for subscribers needs validation.
